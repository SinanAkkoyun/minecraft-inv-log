# Minecraft Inventory Backup System 1.17.1 (Paper/Spigot)

Roll back inventories!

This plugin enables your mods and admins to give someone their EXACT inventory back if they loose their items.

# Motivation
A friend of mine runs a server in which they constantly have problems with their Death Chest system :)

# Usage

With this plugin installed, you can simply /restore <player_name> and a GUI pops up, letting you edit the inventory and finally reverting the desired players inventory to an old backup.
