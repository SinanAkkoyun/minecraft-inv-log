# Minecraft Inventory Backup System

This plugin is a drop in solution for admins that encounter many bugs that delete ones whole inventory.
With this plugin installed, you can simply /restore <player_name> and a GUI pops up, letting you edit the inventory and finally reverting the desired players inventory to an old backup.
